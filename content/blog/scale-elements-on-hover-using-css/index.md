Often we get a requirement to scale images on hover or content block on hover, it can be achieved using CSS through `transform` property

```scss
// Growing in size
.grow:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
// shrinking in size
.shrink:hover {
  transform: scale(0.8);
}
```

Here `transform: scale` property alone can't help the effect to be smooth, in order to get smooth effect, we need to add some `transition` to the elements.

```scss
.grow,
.shrink {
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```
